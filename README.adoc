== Differences with aboutcode-toolkit

[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
^|aboutcode-toolkit
^|gradle-about-plugin
^|Notes/Reasoning

| Handles all custom fields as `StringField` s
a|
*   Respects suffixes described by specification for file and URL
    fields
*   Allows extensibility with custom fields of complex types
a|
1. Simpler extensibility
2. Gives validation of values in custom file and url fields

| Parses `licenses` field into 4 separate lists
| Has designated `License` class
| Simpler architecture

| Requires some string fields to be single line
| Accepts multiline strings as well
| It is not mentioned in specificaton. We consider this as a bug

| Validates contents and returns list of found errors
| Just throws exception when something is not valid
| Use separate Gradle plugin and task to run `about check` and be sure
that ABOUT file is correct

| Reads content of TextFileFields
| Doesn't read
| There was no need

| Stores `Field` name
| Doesn't store `Field` name
a|
1. It's not so easy to get field name from Jackson
2. It's not obvious which name should be assigned to list items
